This Java code uses statistics to identify the type of text entered, also providing probabilistic graphs.
 ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Apache NetBeans IDE 16 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
To identify a text you need to insert it into the folder dedicated to texts, you can still try the examples already present.
The graphs are found inside the .xlsx files, which can be opened with any editor (Excel, Google Sheets, Libre Office Calc...).
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order not to encounter errors.
