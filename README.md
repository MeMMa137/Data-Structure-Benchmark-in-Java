This Java code runs a benchmark test to identify the fastest data structure on your PC.

ðŸ‘¾ TO RUN:
Apache NetBeans IDE 16 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
The benchmark results can be viewed both from the IDE console, but also a simplified version on .xlsx files, which can be opened with any editor (Excel, Google Sheets, Libre Office Calc...).
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order not to encounter errors.
